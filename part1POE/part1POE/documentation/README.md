## Project Overview
This project involves the design and development of a fully functional website
for **Steepd**, a hypothetical artisanal tea shop. The website serves as both an
online store and a promotional platform for a hypothetical physical store location. The goal
is to create a user-friendly and aesthetically pleasing site that showcases the brand's premium products.

## Website Goals and Objectives
The primary goals of the Steepd website are:
- To establish a strong online presence for the Steepd brand.
- To facilitate online sales of artisanal teas through an integrated product page.
- To educate visitors on the history, origin, and preparation methods of different teas.
- To increase foot traffic to the physical store location.
- To fill a market niche for specialized, high-quality teas.

**Key Performance Indicators:**
- Number of online orders placed.
- Number of contact form enquiries submitted.
- Increase in in-store sales tracked via online-promoted offers.
